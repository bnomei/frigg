# Changelog

## 0.2.2 - 2026-04-17

- Replaced permissive `outputSchema.properties.metadata` boolean schemas with explicit object schemas for the affected MCP navigation and symbol-search tools, improving compatibility with strict clients such as Cursor.

## 0.2.1

- Upgraded `rmcp` from `1.2.0` to `1.4.0`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-03-23

- Upgraded `rmcp` from `1.1.0` to `1.2.0`.
- Verified the `frigg` crate builds and its package test suite passes against `rmcp 1.2.0`.
- Restored bounded-SCIP coverage in max-file-bytes tool-handler tests by disabling `full_scip_ingest` in the test helper that exercises budgeted paths.
- Updated the `document_symbols` unsupported-extension expectation to include `.java`, matching the current language registry.
